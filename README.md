  # Animal Rescue TMS - BETA

"Stop, drop, shut 'em down, open up shop 
Oh, no 
That's how Ruff Riders roll "  
-anonymous poet, or a day in the life of animal rescue ops

 We are on a mission to create a FREE mobile responsive tool to help rescue shelters and their network of trusted volunteers coordinate transportation of animals. Collectively all users will be known as the "RUFF RIDERS" who champion the creatures forgotten when they get past puppy age, thrown away when they get old and sick, and just plain old tortured by those who don't know how to make any human friends. Web participation is all done in the process of providing temporary shelter or foster for an animal still in need of a furever home. If someone has a case needing to be transported out of a kill shelter or just rescued in general, all users are able to see a profile of the animal, situation, and location theoretically. For the purpose of this project we are pulling this data from the Petfinder API. A rescue would accept an animal and available drivers to initiate the rescue plan which is then coordinated directly with concerned parties. 

## The Audience
The user is either 
A) someone looking to provide transport for animal rescue OTR (over the road) or AIR
B) someone looking to rescue/adopt an animal into their shelter or foster home

## Getting Started

The user will be greeted by a very simple interface where they choose to click on either button to determine which audience they are, and the tasks alloted to that audience

A) Offering a ride
B) Searching for an animal to foster or take in your shelter

The users will be required to provide info on their location or the type of animal that they are looking to rescue respectively in order to provide the best match. If you are able to provide transport, a final screen will show available animals near you. If you are looking to rehome an animal, you will be able to choose drivers near your chosen locations to provide transport to you or your rescue org.

## Tech Stuff

API's used are 
*Mapbox 
*Petfinder

Design:
*Simplicity is key, we don't want to give rescue shelters another reason to drink more heavily that night
*No prompts, simple drop downs and manual zip code field makes the selection of data speedy and preventative of possible manual errors
*Bootstrap intensive, with cleaner reference to custom css
*Mobile responsive, still working out the kinks with the way tables are displayed on smaller screens + not wrapping in their container

### Outcome

This will mirror the process many rescues follow, but will be more centralized and less dependent on social media combing. This will give shelters time back in their day to work on the most important part of their day- saving animal lives and never being able to wear anything black to work ever again.


## Deployment

To be determined
